## Professional Summary
I work on AI systems at the point where abstractions start to fail: production agents, evaluation pipelines, and AI-first platforms that have to survive real-world constraints. With 12+ years across software engineering, applied ML, and system design, my focus is on turning fragile prototypes into stable, deployable systems by navigating ambiguous requirements, incomplete metrics, and evolving research goals. Currently operating as an independent consultant partnering with startups and research teams on agentic architectures, reliability, and infrastructure beyond the demo stage.

## Professional Experience
### Independent Systems Consultant | September 2024–Present
Partnering with startups, research teams, and product-driven organisations on production SaaS and AI systems, with a focus on agents, evaluation, and system architecture beyond the prototype stage.

**Scope of work:**
- Designing and stabilising agentic systems for real-world deployment
- Architecting SaaS platforms from early design to production readiness
- Evaluation, reliability, and failure-mode analysis under ambiguous requirements
- Translating cutting-edge AI research into deployable engineering systems

**Selected engagements:**

- **Hedera / CNO:** Architected compliance-first tokenization and trading infrastructure (\url{https://cno.zone/})
- **ethereum-protocol-verification:** Built an LLM-powered verification pipeline bridging EIP obligations and execution-specs
- **Dikaio.ai:** Guided the transition of a legal-tech RAG prototype into a production engine
- **Rythm Hoppers:** Built domain-specific SaaS platforms integrating Greek regulatory systems—myDATA invoicing and Viva Wallet POS
- **University of Piraeus:** Conducted applied ML research on credit-risk modelling and feature engineering
- **Rooted Layers:** Author of a technical publication on AI systems and infrastructure (\url{https://lambpetros.substack.com/})

### Senior Software Engineer, NLP Team - Workable (Athens) | 2022-2024
- **Launched** Workable's first generative AI proofs of concept (job-post generation, interview-question drafting, resume parsing), presented company-wide, and secured executive buy-in for productionisation.
- **Built** Python ML microservices powering AI-driven candidate experiences across the hiring platform; deployed via AWS EKS + Kubernetes/Helm with RabbitMQ/Kafka event workflows supporting 10+ services while processing tens of thousands of resumes daily from a 0.5 billion-record corpus.
- **Partnered** with product and design to transform prototypes into deliverables while defining evaluation, deployment, and monitoring standards for the ML stack.

### Senior Software Engineer - NannyML (Remote) | 2021-2022
- **Piloted** monthly ML monitoring prototypes with a six-person EU founding team searching for product-market fit, partnering with research to operationalise drift detection and alerting.
- **Shipped** containerised Python microservices on Amazon EKS with Helm, improving deployment reliability and halving onboarding time for new customers.
- **Championed** CI/CD, testing, and observability investments that underpinned the team's first deals.

### Senior Backend Engineer - Orfium (Athens) | 2020-2021
- **Led** Django/PostgreSQL services for music-licensing operations, ensuring twelve-factor alignment and reliable Heroku releases.
- **Introduced** API design and observability improvements that reduced support load and surfaced actionable analytics for business teams.

### Team Lead - Big Data Engineer - Encode S.A. (Athens) | 2015-2020
- **Architected** a PySpark + Elasticsearch platform processing 100K-user network datasets within a business day, including large-scale performance validation.
- **Optimised** the Python/MySQL pipeline (multiprocessing, Redis caching) to scale throughput from 1K to 10K users while eliminating chronic bottlenecks.
- **Mentored** junior engineers across long-running coaching engagements and embedded with security analysts to convert threat intelligence into production detection pipelines.

### Python Software Developer, Web Applications - Neuropublic (Athens) | 2014-2015
- **Built** Python services for precision-agriculture products forecasting crop returns from environmental and nutritional data models.

### Intern Software Engineer, Data Acquisition - Skyscanner (Edinburgh) | March 2013 - August 2013
- **Owned** Python APIs and scraping pipelines that kept BAU ingestion services running while extending core team coverage.
