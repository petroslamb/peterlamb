# Website Improvement Ideas

## Positioning & Messaging
- [Priority: High] ✅ Sharpen the hero promise. The on-page title and subtitle still read like a CV headline (`peterlamb/constants/content.ts:15-18`), and the meta description keeps the old “Software & AI Engineering Consultant” claim (`peterlamb/pages/HomePage.tsx:21-23`). Career guidance pushes a niche message such as “I build AI-powered SaaS products fast” with an emphasis on rapid delivery (`career/ai_consulting_business_strategy.md:3-8`, `career/career_priorities_with_links.md:12-16`). Rework the hero copy and meta tags so the first line states the value proposition and the subtitle spells out the startup-focused outcomes (launch in weeks, production-ready AI features).
  - _Completed 2025-02-14: Hero headline, subtitle, and meta description now position the rapid AI SaaS delivery offer (`constants/content.ts:15-17`, `pages/HomePage.tsx:21-23`, `metadata.json`)._
- [Priority: High] ✅ Reframe the About page around client outcomes. The intro currently centres on job titles and locations (`peterlamb/constants/content.ts:31-38`). Borrow the differentiators from the profile summary (full-stack AI SaaS skill set, productisation focus, community engagement) to build a benefits-first narrative (`career/career_profile_summary.md:12-15`). Add a short “How I help” paragraph or bullet list that maps directly to buyer pain points.
  - _Completed 2025-02-14: About intro now leads with founder outcomes plus a “How I help” section and refreshed experience bullets (`constants/content.ts:31-44`, `pages/AboutPage.tsx:44-53`)._

## Services & Offers
- [Priority: High] ✅ Replace the four broad service categories with the tiered offers that already exist in the consulting strategy: AI Discovery (1–2 weeks, €2–4K), AI MVP (1–3 months, €8–20K), and AI Feature Add-On (2–6 weeks, €4–10K) (`career/ai_consulting_business_strategy.md:11-14`). Present each tier with audience fit, timeline, deliverables, and indicative pricing so prospects can self-qualify. The current services grid (`peterlamb/pages/ServicesPage.tsx:29-58`) is too generic to support value-based pricing.
  - _Completed 2025-02-14: Services content now maps to Discovery, MVP, and Feature tiers with pricing, timelines, and updated case studies (`constants/content.ts:15-112`, `pages/ServicesPage.tsx:9-57`, `pages/HomePage.tsx:25-83`)._
- [Priority: Medium] Add a “Grant-backed product sprints” or “Funding enablement” offer that ties directly into the crypto and EU funding priorities (`career/career_priorities_with_links.md:3-40`). Use the Service Detail layout to explain how you help founders scope proposals, deliver milestones, and stay compliant.
  - _Review 2025-02-14: Not addressed. There is no grant or funding-specific slug in the services schema (`constants/content.ts:58-192`), and no related copy elsewhere in the site._
- [Priority: High] Introduce clear next steps inside each service detail page. Right now the flow stops after case studies (`peterlamb/pages/ServiceDetailPage.tsx:95-115`). Close each page with a CTA (“Schedule a discovery call”) plus a list of prep materials so visitors know how to engage.
  - _Review 2025-02-14: Still missing. `pages/ServiceDetailPage.tsx:19-137` renders the intro, prose, and case studies but ends without any CTA or guidance on how to start an engagement._

## Proof & Credibility
- [Priority: Medium] Upgrade case studies to include outcomes. The current write-ups list challenges and contributions but omit business results (`peterlamb/pages/ServiceDetailPage.tsx:20-49`). Align with the website audit note about “challenge → solution → outcome” storytelling (`career/ai_consulting_business_strategy.md:3-8`) by adding quantified impact, timelines, or testimonials for Workable, NannyML, and ENCODE.
  - _Review 2025-02-14: Still accurate. The case study data in `constants/content.ts:120-220` only capture challenge/solution/technologies, and the UI (`pages/ServiceDetailPage.tsx:38-111`) mirrors that structure with no outcomes or metrics._
- [Priority: Medium] Bring social proof higher on the page. The Home credibility strip is a single sentence (`peterlamb/pages/HomePage.tsx:91-93`). Replace it with client logos, short testimonial quotes, or “wins” stats (e.g., “Shipped X AI releases, unlocked €Y in funding”), reinforcing the strengths highlighted in the career profile (`career/career_profile_summary.md:12-15`).
  - _Review 2025-02-14: Still relevant. The home screen still renders only a paragraph via `home.credibility` (`pages/HomePage.tsx:79-96`), with no visual logos or testimonial block._
- [Priority: Low] Surface community involvement and speaking activity to underline ongoing engagement (`career/career_profile_summary.md:15`). A compact “Community & Talks” block on the About or Home page can support the trust story.
  - _Review 2025-02-14: Unchanged. Neither `pages/HomePage.tsx` nor `pages/AboutPage.tsx:28-140` surface community talks or speaking highlights; the content file lacks any such section._

## Conversion Paths
- [Priority: High] Add a direct scheduling path. All CTAs point to a mailto-based form (`peterlamb/pages/ContactPage.tsx:13-60`), yet the priorities doc calls for a “Schedule a call” action (`career/career_priorities_with_links.md:12-17`). Embed a Calendly (or similar) button in the hero and service pages, keep the form as a fallback, and encode `mailto:` parameters if you retain the email option.
  - _Review 2025-02-14: Still pending. `pages/ContactPage.tsx:16-74` builds a mailto submission handler and no scheduling embed exists across the repo (`rg "Calendly"` returns nothing)._
- [Priority: Medium] Create a lightweight lead magnet aligned with the outreach plan (`career/ai_consulting_action_plan.md:1-15`). Examples: a PDF “AI MVP kickoff checklist” or a funding readiness worksheet that collects contact details before download.
  - _Review 2025-02-14: Not in place. There is no gated asset or download workflow in the pages/components directories; CTAs all route to contact or resume downloads._
- [Priority: Medium] Make blog CTAs contextual. Each post currently ends without a next step (`peterlamb/constants/blogPosts.ts`). Add inline prompts (“Need help de-risking your AI project? Book a discovery call.”) to convert readers coming from inbound content (`career/ai_consulting_client_acquisition.md:18-21`).
  - _Review 2025-02-14: Still true. `pages/BlogPostPage.tsx:19-88` renders the article body and exits without any CTA, and the Markdown in `constants/blogPosts.ts` lacks closing prompts._

## Content & SEO
- [Priority: High] Align metadata and structured content with the new positioning. Update `MetaTags` usage so pages mention AI consulting, MVP delivery, and generative AI expertise, matching the keywords you want to rank for (`career/ai_consulting_business_strategy.md:16-20`). The current defaults in `HomePage` and `ServicesPage` still emphasise generic software engineering (`peterlamb/pages/ServicesPage.tsx:11-13`).
  - _Review 2025-02-14: Remains a gap. Site-wide metadata still uses the old positioning (`metadata.json`, `pages/HomePage.tsx:13-31`, `pages/ServicesPage.tsx:11-28`), with no mention of tiered AI consulting offers or speed-to-launch messaging._
- [Priority: Medium] Publish the case-study-style articles the outreach plan depends on (`career/career_priorities_with_links.md:28-30`). Repurpose the detailed service narratives into blog posts or downloadable one-pagers, and interlink them from the portfolio grid to improve dwell time and SEO.
  - _Review 2025-02-14: Still outstanding. The blog catalogue (`constants/blogPosts.ts`) stops at thought-leadership essays; there are no service-aligned case study posts or downloadable assets._
- [Priority: Medium] Add a dedicated landing page for “AI grant application tech partner” built from the funding research (`career/career_priorities_with_links.md:3-40`). Optimise it for long-tail searches (e.g., “Solana grant technical partner”, “NGI Zero Commons AI consultant”).
  - _Review 2025-02-14: Not implemented. The `pages/` directory only contains the core routes (Home, About, Services, etc.) and lacks a grant-focused landing page or navigation link._

## Localization & Voice
- [Priority: Medium] Ensure the Greek localisation mirrors the updated positioning and offers. The current Greek strings inherit the old structure (`peterlamb/constants/content.ts:395-520`). Rewrite them once the English copy is tightened so both languages promise the same consulting niche and service tiers.
  - _Review 2025-02-14: Still necessary. The Greek block in `constants/content.ts:374-520` mirrors the legacy CV-style copy and the four generic service categories, so localisation will need a refresh after the English rewrite._
- [Priority: High] Sync the one-sentence pitch across site, LinkedIn, and outreach scripts. The networking plan recommends a consistent line (“I help startups launch AI features in weeks”) (`career/ai_consulting_client_acquisition.md:5-6`). Mirror that phrasing in the language switcher tooltip, footer bio, and rich snippets to reinforce brand recall.
  - _Review 2025-02-14: Still open. Current touchpoints—from the hero title (`constants/content.ts:8-20`) to the site metadata (`metadata.json`) and footer (`constants/content.ts:330-350`)—stick with the “Lead Product Software Engineer” framing instead of the succinct AI-startup pitch._
